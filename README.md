# Giphy-Project

* This project takes an array of topics, in this case, comedic actresses and outputs them as buttons. 

* When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gifs images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

* The rating of the gif is dsipalyed under every gif

* There is also a form that takes a value from a user input box and adds it to your `topics` array, and adds it as a button to the page.
